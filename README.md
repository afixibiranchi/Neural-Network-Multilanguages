# Neural-Network-Multilanguages
implement Gradient Descent Feed-forward and Recurrent Neural Network on different languages.

Feed-forward Neural Network will train using Iris dataset.

## Support

- [x] Ruby
- [x] Python
- [x] Javascript
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Julia
- [ ] PHP

## Instructions

1. Go to any language folder.
2. run install.sh
3. run the program.

## Status

Will update overtime.

## Warning

You would not see high accuracy for other languages beside Python even you implemented mini-batch or stochastic learning because float variables become saturated or addition / minus is too small.
